# iOS Course Repository

This repository contains sample projects for an iOS course. A small command-line
snake game has been added for fun and practice.

## Snake Game

The `snake.py` script uses Python's `curses` library to implement a simple
terminal-based snake game. Use the arrow keys (or WASD) to control the snake.

Run it with:

```bash
python3 snake.py
```

The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself. Your score is displayed
when the game ends.
